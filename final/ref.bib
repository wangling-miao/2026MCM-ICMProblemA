  abstract = {Lithium-ion cells currently power almost all electronic devices and power tools; they are a key enabling technology for electric vehicles and are increasingly considered to be the technology of choice for grid storage. In line with this increased applicability, there is also an increase in the development of new commercial lithium-ion cell technologies that incorporate innovative functional components (electrode material compositions and electrolyte formulations) and designs, leading to a diverse range of performance characteristics. The uniqueness of each technology in-turn gives rise to unique evolutions of cell performance as the cell degrades because of usage. Non-destructively measuring and subsequently tracking the evolution of lithium-ion cell characteristics is valuable for both industrial engineers and academic researchers. To proceed in this regard, stakeholders have often devised their own procedures for characterising lithium-ion cells, typically without considering unification, comparability or compatibility. This makes the comparison of technologies complicated. This comprehensive review for the first time has analysed and discusses the various international standards and regulations for the characterisation and electrical testing of lithium-ion cells, specifically for high-power automotive and grid applications.}

Former operation strategies made use of voltage limits only to protect the battery against deep discharge and overcharge. Currently, battery operation is changing to what could rather be called battery management than simply protection. For this improved battery control, the battery SOC is a key factor. Much research work has been done in recent years to improve SOC determination. Operational conditions differ for batteries in, for example, photovoltaic applications, (hybrid)-electric vehicles or telecommunications. Hence, a given method for SOC calculation will be more suitable for a certain application than for another. The authors introduce commonly used methods for SOC determination and establish a relationship between the advantages of the different methods and the most common applications. As a main illustration, the analysis of Kalman filter technique for lead-acid battery SOC determination are presented and some results for other calculation methods as well.}

We combined analyses of transport and kinetics in determining resulting stresses, which arise from concentration gradients in cathode particles, and heat generation. Two peaks in boundary reaction flux, and resulting stresses, were determined from the modeling of electrochemical kinetics and diffusion, using intrinsic material properties (resulting in two plateaus in the open-circuit potential) and the applied potential. Resistive heating was identified as the most important heat generation source. To probe the impact of the particle shape (equivalent radius and aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle) and the potential sweep rate on stress and heat generation, a surrogate-based analysis was also conducted. The systematic study showed that both intercalation-induced stress and time-averaged resistive heat generation rate increase with particle radius and potential sweep rate. Intercalation-induced stress increases first, then decreases as the aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle increases, whereas time-averaged resistive heat generation rate decreases as aspect ratio increases. This surrogate-based analysis suggests that ellipsoidal particles with larger aspect ratios are preferred over spherical particles, in improving battery performance when stress and heat generation are the only factors considered.}

This paper illustrates the parameterization of a holistic aging model from accelerated aging tests. More than 60 cells of the same type are tested to analyze different impact factors. In calendar aging tests three temperatures and various SOC are applied to the batteries. For cycle aging tests especially different cycle depths and mean SOC are taken into account. Capacity loss and resistance increase are monitored as functions of time and charge throughput during the tests. From these data physical based functions are obtained, giving a mathematical description of aging. To calculate the stress factors like temperature or voltage, an impedance based electric-thermal model is coupled to the aging model. The model accepts power and current profiles as input, furthermore an ambient air temperature profile can be applied. Various drive cycles and battery management strategies can be tested and optimized using the lifetime prognosis of this tool. With the validation based on different realistic driving profiles and temperatures, a robust foundation is provided.}

For cells formed and aged at 45°C for 40 weeks (capacity fade = 7.5%), the analysis indicated negligible loss of accessible material at the anode and at the cathode. Capacity loss of the cell could be accounted for, largely, by side reactions at the anode. This type of analysis can be used when the introduction of a reference electrode is difficult or impractical.}

The model is able to simulate a wide variety of battery aging profiles, e.g., open-circuit and constant-voltage storage, charge/discharge cycling, etc. An analysis of capacity-fade data from the literature reveals that the same set of aging parameters may be used for predicting cycling and constant-voltage storage.

The multi-swarm particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to identify the optimal model parameters for the two types of Li-ion cells.

Firstly an equivalent circuit model with n RC networks is employed modeling the polarization characteristic and the dynamic behavior of the lithium-ion battery, the corresponding equations are built to describe its electric behavior and a recursive function is deduced for the online identification of the OCV, which is implemented by a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with an optimal forgetting factor. The models with different RC networks are evaluated based on the terminal voltage comparisons between the model-based simulation and the experiment. Then the OCV-SOC lookup table is built based on the experimental data performed by a linear interpolation of the battery voltages at the same SOC during two consecutive discharge and charge cycles. Finally a verifying experiment is carried out based on nine Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedules. It indicates that the proposed method can ensure an acceptable accuracy of SOC estimation for online application with a maximum error being less than 5.0%.}

  abstract = {Battery equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are widely employed in online battery management applications. The model parameters are known to vary according to the operating conditions, such as the battery state of charge (SOC). Therefore, online recursive ECM parameter estimation is one means that may help to improve the modelling accuracy. Because a battery system consists of both fast and slow dynamics, the classical least squares (LS) method, that estimates together all the model parameters, is known to suffer from numerical problems and poor accuracy. The aim of this paper is to overcome this problem by proposing a new decoupled weighted recursive least squares (DWRLS) method, which estimates separately the parameters of the battery fast and slow dynamics. Battery SOC estimation is also achieved based on the parameter estimation results. This circumvents an additional full-order observer for SOC estimation, leading to a reduced complexity. An extensive simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed method against the LS technique. Experimental data are collected using a Li ion cell. Finally, both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed DWRLS approach can improve not only the modelling accuracy but also the SOC estimation performance compared with the LS algorithm.}

The equation developed incorporates these effects in a complete and general manner. Simplifications and special cases are discussed. The results of applying the energy balance to a mathematical model of the  cell discharged through two different reaction mechanisms are given as examples. The examples illustrate how the energy equation may be applied to a specific system to examine the relative contributions corresponding to the terms in the equation. The examples show that the processes involved in cell heat generation may be complex and that the application of a sufficiently general energy equation is advantageous.}

  abstract = {Battery management systems in hybrid-electric-vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack’s present operating condition. These include: battery state-of-charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose methods, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that are able to accomplish these goals for a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that they will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. This third paper concludes the series by presenting five additional applications where either an EKF or results from EKF may be used in typical BMS algorithms: initializing state estimates after the vehicle has been idle for some time; estimating state-of-charge with dynamic error bounds on the estimate; estimating pack available dis/charge power; tracking changing pack parameters (including power fade and capacity fade) as the pack ages, and therefore providing a quantitative estimate of state-of-health; and determining which cells must be equalized. Results from pack tests are presented.}

Correlations for variation of capacity fade parameters with cycling were obtained with two different approaches. The first approach takes into account only the active material loss, while the second approach includes rate capability losses too. Both methods use correlations for variation of the film resistance with cycling. The state of charge (SOC) of the limiting electrode accounts for the active material loss. The diffusion coefficient of the limiting electrode was the parameter to account for the rate capability losses during cycling.}

  abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) is the useful life left on an asset at a particular time of operation. Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not. We systematically review the models and approaches reported in the literature and finally highlight future research challenges.}

However, continuously capturing this contextual information on mobile devices drains device battery very quickly. In this paper, we study the tradeoff between device energy consumption and user state recognition accuracy from a novel perspective. We assume the user state evolves as a hidden discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) and an embedded sensor on mobile device discovers user state by performing a sensing observation. We investigate a stationary deterministic sensor sampling policy which assigns different sensor duty cycles based on different user states, and propose two state estimation mechanisms providing the best ``guess'' of user state sequence when observations are missing. We analyze the effect of varying sensor duty cycles on (a) device energy consumption and (b) user state estimation error, and visualize the tradeoff between the two numerically for a two-state setting.},

  abstract = {Mobile application use has become an essential activity in many people鈥檚 daily lives in the mobile Internet era. Driven by its ubiquity and strong context dependence, Internet companies are in a race of cross-industry expansion to build a seamless ecosystem incorporating various contexts. Amid such trends, a better understanding of cross-app uses and the impact of contexts becomes critical and imperative. Yet, research on cross-app uses in information systems and marketing is scarce. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. We develop a hidden Markov model to study cross-app uses (choice and duration), capturing their interdependence and the impacts of contextual factors. We calibrate it using a consumer panel that contains real-time app use information. Our key findings are as follows. (1) In addition to the utilitarian and hedonic states behind consumer decisions identified in prior literature, we uncover a novel social state behind mobile user behavior. App use behavior exhibits large differences across three states. (2) Within-state app interdependence is strongest in the hedonic state, followed by the social and utilitarian states. (3) Social state is the most transient (i.e., mostly likely to switch away), followed by the hedonic and utilitarian states. (4) Contextual factors鈥攊n particular, location and time of day鈥攊nfluence the state dynamic. Compared with the intrinsic state transition, being at home or on the way (versus office) and in the morning or evening (versus night) leads to higher volatility. We discuss the managerial implications for a variety of mobile digital strategies.},
